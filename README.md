# Trinity

## Description

This is a free and open-source alternative to Adobe Animate

There are a few reasons why a software like this should exist, but namely:

 - Animate costs a decent amount of money

 - Animate is now Animate *CC* or "Creative Cloud" which is Adobe's __paid subscription service__

Why Haskell?

 - Because I want to get better at Haskell

 - Because I enjoy using Haskell

 - Because it's possible to do in Haskell

Why "Trinity"?

 - Adobe is not named after the house building style, but instead the Adobe River in Santa Clara, California

 - I'm from Dallas, Texas, so I've named this software after a river there instead, the Trinity River

## Goals

Too many to list here. See my notes in "Adobe Animate Alternative.md"

Essentially I need to create software that can replace most if not all of the functionality of Adobe Animate

## Build and Run

To build do

```stack build```

To run do

```stack exec trinity```

or on Windows

or on Linux
