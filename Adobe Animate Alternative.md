# Adobe Animate Alternative Notes

## Name Origin

Adobe (the company) is named after the Adobe River in Santa Clara, California

My software will be called Trinity Animator with Trinity being named after the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas

## Uses of Adobe Animate

 - Frame by Frame Animation
 - Web Animation
 - Web Banners & Adverts
 - Flash Games
 - More

I will try to do all but allow flash games (as flash is deprecated now anyway)

## How to Use Animate

This will be basically a list of things I have to include

 - Vector objects akin to Illustrator

   - Scaled drawings and shapes don't blur when scaled

 - Timeline based animation

   - Keyframes -> Places of changed content; shortcut for new is F6
   
   - Frames -> Content of the last keyframe; comma and period buttons move frame by frame

   - Blank Keyframes -> Empty Keyframes w/ out context

 - 2 supported animation

   - Traditional frame by frame -> Image then another then another

   - Tweening -> Computer automatically figures out the rest

 - Draw in animate

    - Drawing tablet support needed!

    - Multiple layers per frame; Hide frames as well

    - Move objects around (vecotrs again)

    - Various object properties off to the side

    - Basic paint tools
      
      * Shapes: Circles, Squares, etc

      * Line tool

      * Brushes

      * Color options

      * Import images

      * Base off of paint.NET

 - Playing animation within tool

 - Export to various video formats

 - Set fps, background color, and window size

 - Lock objects so you can't accidentally click

 - F5 -> Fills in frames up to selection on timeline

 - Be able to add points to vector lines to adjust (handles)

 - Shape hints for tweening
